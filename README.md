# MusicProgramming
This interface uses Processing through Java. My interface consists of three sections.   
The first section consists of a further subsections which contain pitch, shade and gain parameters, these parameters were obtained from the cp5 library.
The second section contains a toggle and knob, both obtained from the cp5 library. 
Once the user turns on the toggle a visual representation of a sound file will appear, i.e. groove.mp3 is used in this instance through the minim library. 
The final section is a band pass filter that is triggered by an on/off toggle switch.
